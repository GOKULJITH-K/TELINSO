                           Soil health and crop productivity are one of the main issues in agriculture as they may lead 
                           to an unhealthy environment. The main cause of this is the use of excessive fertilizers in 
                           the soil. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct soil testing before starting agriculture.
                            A soil test is important for several reasons: to optimize crop production, to improve the
                             nutritional balance of the growing media and to save money and conserve energy by applying 
                             only the amount of fertilizer needed. Our solution is designed to aid a farmer in all aspects,
                              including monitoring soil conditions and nutrients. The data collected from the monitoring system will be stored on a cloud server for analysis. The main objective is to keep track of the level of nutrients in the soil. Knowing their soil 
                           before starting farming will assist farmers in planning cultivation with precision.</P>
